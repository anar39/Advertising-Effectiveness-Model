# Advertising-effectiveness-model
The project consists of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, followed by the implementation of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. Subsequently, the primary advertising model is developed, and the results are interpreted. Finally, the project concludes with managerial insights drawn from the analysis and a discussion of its limitations.
